      \n\nWhen a core checkout feature isn't rendered, neither are the static extension points tied to it. For example, shipping methods aren't shown when customers select the option for store pickup and the UI extensions that load before or after the shipping method aren't rendered.

        "This library provides an alias for `shopify.extend` in the form of the `extend()` export. This function is also strongly-typed. If you’re working in an editor that supports TypeScript’s language server (we recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)), then you get feedback about the input arguments to that extension point. \n\n For extensions that render UI, such as [`Checkout::Dynamic::Render`](#extension-points), the first argument is always a [`@remote-ui` `RemoteRoot` object](https://github.com/Shopify/remote-ui/tree/main/packages/core#remoteroot) that enables you to render UI components into your extension point in checkout. You don't need to explicitly call [`mount()`](https://github.com/Shopify/remote-ui/tree/main/packages/core#remoterootmount) on this object. After the callback that you registered for the extension point ends, or if it returns a `Promise` that resolves, your initial UI is rendered. \n\n That’s really all the global API you need to know to start writing a UI extension. You’ll find the documentation for additional APIs that are provided when an extension point is run in the [extension points API documentation](/api/checkout-ui-extensions/extension-points-api).",

This includes `Set`, `Map`, `Promise`, `Symbol`, and more. You should rely on these globals directly when you need them, and you shouldn't use your own polyfill for any of these features. If you use globals added after ES2015, or new static methods on globals added after ES2015 (like `Object.entries`), then you must polyfill your usage of these features. \n\n Your UI extension shouldn't ship any ES2015 (or newer) syntax, like [`class`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/class), [`const/let`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const), or [`for..of` loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of).
